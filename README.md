# Automobile-Sales-EDA-Project
  
## Project Description 
This project demonstrates the power of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in understanding datasets. EDA is a crucial step in data science pipelines, enabling analysts to uncover trends, anomalies, and relationships within data, paving the way for effective decision-making and modeling.  

## ‚ú® Key Highlights  
- **Data Cleaning:** Address missing values and optimize data structure for analysis.  
- **Statistical Summaries:** Gain quick insights through descriptive statistics.  
- **Data Visualization:** Utilize plots to highlight patterns, trends, and correlations.  
- **Feature Exploration:** Investigate relationships between variables.  

## üöÄ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation  
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical computations  
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for visualization  

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions  
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.  
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.  
3. Install the necessary dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn  
   ```  
4. Open the notebook:  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook project_eda.ipynb  
   ```  

## üìÇ Project Workflow  
1. **Dataset Overview:** Understand the structure and attributes of the dataset.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing, inconsistent, or duplicate entries.  
3. **Descriptive Statistics:** Explore key metrics like mean, median, and variance.  
4. **Visualization:** Create graphs like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps.  
5. **Insights and Observations:** Summarize the findings and their implications.  

## üìà Visualizations and Insights  
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** Identify relationships between numerical variables.  
- **Distribution Plots:** Observe data spread and detect skewness.  
- **Box Plots:** Highlight outliers and variability in the data.  

## üìÑ Dataset Description  
The dataset used for this project contains 2,747 rows and 20 columns. It captures details of auto sales transactions, including customer information, product details, sales figures, and shipping status. Below is an overview of key columns:

ORDERNUMBER: Unique identifier for each order.
QUANTITYORDERED: Quantity of products ordered.
PRICEEACH: Price per unit of the product.
SALES: Total sales amount for the order.
ORDERDATE: Date the order was placed.
DAYS_SINCE_LASTORDER: Number of days since the customer's previous order.
STATUS: Current shipping status of the order.
PRODUCTLINE: Category of the product (e.g., Motorcycles).
CUSTOMERNAME: Name of the customer.
COUNTRY: Customer's country of residence.

Dataset Highlights
Size: 2,747 records across 20 attributes.
Completeness: No missing values in the dataset.
Potential Use Cases:
Sales trend analysis
Customer segmentation
Order fulfillment and shipping efficiency analysis  

## üåü Future Enhancements  
- Perform advanced feature engineering.  
- Incorporate machine learning models for prediction.  
- Automate the EDA process with interactive dashboards.
